One of the biggest news stories of the decade just broke and I can hardly cover it. 5 videos removed in 2 days. And they don't even just remove it, they can now just make the videos ineligible for recommendation and just look what that does. You guys won't even see it. Bro, sometimes I feel like I am at war with the platform that is supposed to be my ally. To date they have tried to permanently ban my account for reasons we still don't know. They've dropped my RPM down to the lowest amount possible 0.01 cent. They routinely unfairly take down videos, some of which take entire days of research and editing. They don't give me a reason for the removal, just community guidelines. And sometimes they even block me out of the appeals process by just glitching the page. Brother, do you not want me on this app? Every man has his breaking point. And this is all while I have never had a single post taken down on YouTube or Instagram. So the content is not the problem. So as a form of protest, the only place you will find me for the next few days is YouTube? Man, they probably gonna take this down too."

      "transcript_raw": "That, why did USA attack Venezuela and capture their president? Because they wanted their entire oil reserve, which is almost 18% of the entire world, number one. But dad, the USA itself has a large oil reserve. Yeah, they have a large oil reserve, but they want to control the entire petrodollar equation. But dad, what's a petrodollar? So, for that, we have to go back to history. 1974 mein, Henry Kissinger, who was the National Security advisor to the president of US, Nixon. He went to Saudi Arabia, and he cracked a deal. He said, \"Ki bhai, jo bhi aap crude produce karoge, bechoge market mein, woh dollar mein bechoge. Aur uski jagah hum aapko military support de denge.\" Ab jaise hi crude dollar mein bikega, to dollar ka demand badhega. To US ne dollar chhapna chalu kar diya, print karna chalu kar diya, and dollar became the reserve currency of the world. Because pura crude oil ka trade dollar mein ho raha tha. Ab dheere dheere kuch countries ne aake isko challenge kiya. Sabse pehle Iraq ne challenge kiya, year 2000 mein. Saddam Hussein ne kaha ki main isko euro mein bechunga. To 2003 mein, yeh bol diya gaya weapons of mass destruction hai, aur Iraq pe attack kar diya. Fir 2009 mein, Libya ke Gaddafi ne bola ki main jo crude hai usko gold ke saath pack kar dunga. To fir usko bhi marwa diya. Aur ab 2025 mein, bhai saahab isko bhi happy New Year kar diya iska bhi. Toh, toh iska happy New Year ho gaya. Issue yeh tha ki Venezuela wala keh raha tha ki main China ko bhi bechunga yuan mein, main Russia ko bechunga ruble mein, aur wo BRICS mein judna chahta tha. BRICS jo hai Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa. Is group mein Venezuela wala judna chahta tha. Now, BRICS controls 40% of the world GDP. Right? So, America was afraid that if Venezuela with so much oil reserve joins the BRICS, to kya hoga? Sari power in log ke paas aa jayegi aur dheere dheere dollar ka might khatam ho jayega. Yeh sari war isliye ki ja rahi hai taki dollar ko protect kiya jae. Kyunki dollar protect nahi hoga to USA protect nahi hoga. Kyunki US chahta hai ki pura world sirf dollar pe kaam kare. Aur haan, abhi kuch dino ke andar Donald Trump ek aur country pe attack karne wala hai. Comment next if you want to know the next country."

But it's not just about that. There is much more into this. It's about what happened behind the scenes. The transfer strategy. The official rant yesterday in press conference by Ruben Amorim after the game against Leeds United, mentioning, I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not head coach. And that message to the club was really strong, powerful, but also made the things complicated internally. And so today, in the first hours of the day, Manchester United management and owners decided to fire Ruben Amorim with immediate effect. Manchester United have been already looking for a new head coach in the recent minutes. Now it's gonna be time for the process to appoint a new manager. But it's over. Amorim is, from today, no longer the manager of Manchester United. It's game over."

      "transcript_raw": "I’m curious why the Trump administration decided to leave it intact and only arrest Nicolás Maduro and his wife. The person who controls the police, the chief thug, Diosdado Cabello. He's the interior minister. He's been indicted by the United States. He was in that indictment the administration released. He's a narco-terrorist. There's a $25 million price on his head. He's still in place. The defense minister, who has deep ties to Russia, $15 million price on his head. He is still in place. I'm confused. Are they still wanted by the United States? Why didn't you arrest them if you are taking out the narco-terrorist regime? You're confused? I don't know why that's confusing to you. They're still in power. I mean, it’s very simple. You're not going to go in and wrap up — You're going to — But, yeah — but you can't go — You're going to go in and suck up five people? They're already complaining about this one operation. Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people. We got the top priority. The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country, that he was not. And he was arrested along with his wife, who's also indicted. And that was a pretty sophisticated, and frankly, complicated operation. It was. It is not easy to land helicopters in the middle of the largest military base in the country. The guy lived on a military base. Land within three minutes, kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, put him in a helicopter, and leave the country without losing any American or any American assets. That's not an easy mission. And you're asking me, why didn't we do that in five other places at the same time? I mean, that's absurd. I do think this is one of the most, you know, daring, you know, complicated, sophisticated missions this country has carried out in a very long time. Tremendous credit to the U.S. military personnel who did it. It was unbelievable, and tremendous success. And today, an indicted drug trafficker, who was not the legitimate president of Venezuela, who we don't recognize, the Biden administration didn't recognize, 60 something countries don't recognize, the European Union doesn't recognize, and many countries in Latin America don't recognize. He was a convict — he was an indicted drug trafficker. He was arrested, his wife was arrested and also indicted. And they are now facing justice in an American system of courts. The others who were also indicted are still in place. So, that’s the point of my questioning, there. But you talked about not being the legitimate president — So, you wanted us to land in five other military bases? No, I'm asking why you chose that this was the limit of the military operation. But to your point that you just made that Well, because — Maduro was not the legitimate president. He was the guy who was claiming to be the president. Right. Well, the opposition —"
